## How does it work?

Data is sourced from the undocumented NHL Stats API. Matches get updated on every minutes.

Terminal interface built with [react-blessed](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed). Inspired by [world-cup-2018-cli-dashboard](
https://github.com/cedricblondeau/world-cup-2018-cli-dashboard).

## FAQ

#### Q: Data is not showing up?

If an API call fails, we log a debug message. Press `F12` to see the debug console, some helpful messages may show up (a 503 or a 429 HTTP code for instance).
